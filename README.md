## What I Learned

I feel like I've learnt a lot making this Netflix Copycat. This was my firsts project made with ReactJS connected to a DataBase so it was all pretty much new to me! 

When you are used to basic Html and CSS, you get really used to make everything at once, on the same place, it took me a bit to take the habit of separating each thing into their own Components, so you can later reuse them if you need it.

These Components makes things easy but, they have their things too! You can't connect them as easily as something that is in the same page so, you need so much order on your folders and naming. 

Connecting the API (Express JS) to the main APP was one of the hardest parts of the project, make the CRUD works was a torture in my firsts attemps, but when it works, it was a relieve and I understand how calls works on Frameworks.

It was a demanding work but I enjoyed with the final results. 

‚úÖ Use of Components and Hooks on React JS

‚úÖ Connect to an API <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luismi-sg/NETFLIX-API" > Netflix API </a>with Express JS

‚úÖ Make my own DataBase on Mongo DB

‚úÖ Execute a CRUD that links DB with APP
